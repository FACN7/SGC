# Week 8

## Intro to Express
Karem - It's just information, but it's good. If we didn't have Shireen we would have skimmed over it

## App Drawer MC
Karem - Good stuff to copy
Mario - Oof!
Natalia - I liked it
Mario - Noone did it apart from Karem & Natalia
Kira - Everyone else gave up
Omri - I didn't like it, I don't like animation
Karem - It was disconnected to the topic of Express
Mario - Every website has a sidebar
Karem - Then do it in week two
Mario - They're easy
Natalia - Unless you have to clear cache
Karem - It would be a good workshop to do after flexbox-froggy
Omri - We were focussed on Express, it's unclear why it was put into this week
Mario - It's meant to be a break from Express/HB


## Express WS
Hosen - It's very long!
Jamie - It took about 3 1/2 hrs
Hosen - Code along was good but too long
Hosen - Maybe break it up with another workshop
Karem - I think adding a recap would have helped, stating flow of Express
Hosen - Maybe a challenge after each step
Mario - It's already modularised
Hosen - It's long
Omri - We should have spent more time learning to structure our app
Karem - You say longer, he says shorter

## Testing Express Router
Mohammed - It's ok, but it's testing. We didn't have enough time after Node Girls refactor
Karem - It's good to learn to test a new technology
Mohammed - Why should I learn to test the route?
Mario - What if you change your api in a month?
Karem - Not clear if it's about testing or using Postman, maybe we need workshop about Postman


## Node Girls Refactor
Mohammed - It was good but need more time
Hosen - I agree
Mohammed - You need to understand both core node and express, it takes long
Jamie - Also had weird bug where form wasn't set up to work with body parser 

## Handlebars Presentation
Mario - Did I talk too fast?
Omri - It was fast and clear

## HB reading
Mario - It's a meh
Karem - It's difference between having a mentor present, and reading. We just skimmed over reading
Mario - Good to know

## HB WS
Omri - It was important and challenging

## Research
Karem - I put a sarcastic plus, but it was useful

## Express-HB MC
Natalia - It was good
Karem - Useful! It was nice
Kareem - There was comment in readme for exercise 4 which needs to be moved up, Ibrahim had to point it out to me
Omri - Too easy

## Itzek talk
MOhammed - Out of the blue
Kira - He's good speaker but topic is not relavent now
Natalia - But useful for anyone who wants to
Mario - Life finds a way, I pitched one month after finishing and I got funds


## Project
Karem - they were good, thanks for not requiring us to do Auth
Natalia - Helpful for timing
Mohammed - We need more time for projects so we can add auth and include everything in Express

# SGC

## Stop

### Research
Karem - Aren't we going to research in react
Omri - It would be better to replace research with exercises
Karem - How about doing research without presentations, and just including links to resources on readme?
Jamie - Would you read other teams resources
Karem - No, but I don't learn from their presentations either
Hosen - Maybe give challenges rather than research
Karem - How about two teams researching same topics and comparing resources?

### Long code alongs
Hosen - I spoke about this earlier, maybe it could be split up between two days with other exercises inbetween

### Stop being late
Natalia - It's demotivating rest of group, especially rest of group. It's ridiculous
Mario - It's annoying when you all complain about not having enough time, then you are late
Natalia - First 1 person is late, then everyone is


## Go

### React
Karem - Sarcastic entry

### Understand all your code
Karem - I don't mind this
Natalia - It's bad, what's the sense of showing code you don't understand
Karem - You can't use fancy things, if you limit yourself 
Natalia - Packages are different though, you don't need to understand everything. But copying CSS is different
Mario - What if Client asks for small change you can't do?
Natalia - And you shouldnt tell client you just copied it


## Continue

### 5 mins break
Omri - It's refreshing

### Free standup on presentation
Natalia - More relaxed style is more engaging to watch

### teams of 2
Natalia - Easier to communicate
Mario - Fasted project I did was team of 2

### Planning
Hosen - Makes project easier, writing code is easier, task delegation is very important
