## Modern frontend & how React fits in + - -
Moe: I think it wasnt good, because it was very long and confusing, i didn't understand how to relate to react, cause it was at the beginning.
Karem: i think where does react come between ssr and csr is a bit confusing where does it fit exactly, if we were given like a source or a homework, something to read for example to help us understand. explain to us the entire data flow, from as soon as someone goes into a url until a finished response.
Jaime: i agree this presentaion and i agree a lot with moe about it being long and confusing between ssr and csr and react, when you ahvent touched any react yet. i wasn't originally down to give that presentation so i haven't done as much preparation as the bundler's talk.
kira: it should probably be updated or changed
Karem: if we had some sort of previous knowledge it would have helped us understand better, cause we don't know what react is and why we talking about this.
Natalia: it was confusing

_talking about the week and general, and asking students why didn't they pair up together to help each other's understanding.
Moe: no one really understood anything so it was hard to help each other, i  got lost and wasn't able to ask meaningful questions
Karem: in general we didn't understand why stuff was working and how, just that it's working.
Jaime: it feels worrying that you don't understandd anything and you don't say anything about
Kira: instead of being frustrated ask the mentors or fellow students for help.
Karem: i think lack of experience in react affected that (mario: what?)_
## React API ++(+/-)

Karem: i felt like i understood it, but when it became complicated i got confused.

## Build a filterable product page +++

Natalia: it's awesome.

## Destructuring morning challenge ++++

Karem: i think it was good.
Natalia: it made it clear for me, and a good practice

## Intro to bundlers talk +++
Karem: i think its something we are going to have to use in the future.
Omri: too advanced for now. but still we need to know what they do.
Karem: i just understood that i don't need to configure anything and just use it for magic to happen, maybe at work enviroments i should but not now.

## React with Dynamic Data ++++

Moe and Karem: it was good.

## Testing React components ++++
Karem: it was good i think we should know that, and it taught what it should, it was actually fun _natalia agrees_

## Refactoring classes to hooks morning + challenge +++-
Moe: it this point i didnt understand anything, i don't know if anyone knows the old school approach to react which is classes, so it was more advanced for now.
Karem: it's confusing.
Natalia: what is even a hook? it didn't say anywhere
Mario: maybe because it didn't want to add more confusion.
Karem: shoulda said it's the new syntax.
Jaime: did anyone watch the amazing talk by Dan Abramov about hooks? its on gitter

## Project ++++

_nothing_


# STOP GO CONTINUE

## STOP

### Karem's shitty donald trump memes +
Mario : its just annoying in class
Karem: yeah its the last time you are going to hear it
### Waiting to give feedback
Jaime: its mine we talked about this before, but if you don't understand and it's stopping you from doing a workshop so please please stop and tell a mentor.
## GO 
### introduce React's logic, code flow and props with code along and small ex .
Moe: i meant to say we need to see small examples before we actually start coding anything, like a hello world app etc.
Jaime: were the examples in the early workshops too big cause i thoguht they were small
Moe: it's also a timing problem there wasn't enough time and i didn;t understand.
Jaime:im sure other people had issues with that workshop, don't just keep quiet. 
Karem: i want something to read to understabd further, for example props, and how to pass data between components.

### if you're going to miss a day, tell us a day before... i need to get that into my work flow 
Jaime: what do you guys think about people being off? we already had a talk with shireen about this but how does it make you guys feel.
Omri: we cant judge them aybe they have their own reasons
Jaime:we are moving to bigger projects so this is going to be a problem.
Kira: it's going to be a team of 4.
Karem: it;s going to be more personal like calling people so they can come to class
Moe: part of the people didn't come cause they didn't understand, except that week ithink people did come.
Mario: *growns*
Jaime: so people have been saying im going to stay home and teach myself. but what if people have learned different material than the course's one.
Karem: it's going to be more strict the next week cause its more on the line.
Jaime: and you think people will come next week cause its more on the line
Kare: Yes
Natlia: i don't like people are not dedicated, i will be pissed off if teammates are missing and we are not able to finish a project because of them. maybe we should tell them we expect you to do X and you must do it , and if you are watching a udemy course instead of coming here maybe we kick you out of the proejct
Jaime: what do you guys think of that?
Karem:i dont understand you said you will get pissed of about it ?
Natlia: yes if he decided not to come for any good reason, there is plenty of ways to solve problems missing class shouldn't be one of it.
Kira: maybe you should bring it up to your fellow studenets
Jaime: at the end of the day it affects you guys or messes up your projects, at the end its damaging you guys. like we are here to help you guys but you need to bring it up to the others.
Jaime: do you think we should have smaller teams?
Omri: Yes
Karem: are we going to be a team of four? 
jaime and kira yes depends on the idea
omri its a bad idea, you wouldn't understand anything if we split
kira but you would build a smaller projects
Mario : i mean history showed that teamwork can always achieve more than a team of 1, so you will learn much more by working together
omri: the point here is to understand though and not to finish a lot of stuff and i wantn to undestand and cover everythin
Jaime: if anyone has any more thoughts of how to handle this  situation tell us
omri its not our business
kira if they are your teamates then you are dependant on them, they are working with you on a projefct you planned together
omri its not our business
kira you shouldnt just be quiet and do nothing about it.
omri there is a mangement in this course
mario what people have missed in this cohort is that this course is for you by you, there is a reason why we call outselves mentors and not teachers, a lot of other cohorts would come to class and just start workshops on their own cause its their course 
omri its a lot of personal responsiblity 
karem i think we can talk about this for hours


### Please decide who's taking the garbage out, the room is a mess.

Karem - Today I'm taking it out
Kira - Someone needs to be responsible each week
Kareem - Maybe we should take a chart, I'll bring one on Sunday


### Coming up with project ideas for next week

Jamie - Reminder to come up with ideas for Sunday

### Team names

Mario - just have team names instead just first names for project teams and repos

### let us choose project's teams 

Jaime: you will be choosing project teams now, in the next weeks. so people are going to pitching and you can choose which team you want to be on.

## CONTINUE

### Making cool projects

Jaime: just i thought all projcets this week were really great, there was also a definite step up from the stuff you were doing before which is pretty cool
