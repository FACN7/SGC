# Week 7

## Password MGT Presentation
Moses - Good presentation


## Password MGT / Hashing WS
Moses - Simple to understand

## Cookies WS
Moses - Good to understand cookies and concepts, but don't understand everything
Mohammed - Impossible to do without solution
Ariel - Heard that everyone struggled with cookies, need to learn more about it
Moses - We learnt from looking at the solution, but this seems wrong to do that. We had no other choice
Ariel - Bad if you don't understand solution
Faris - Who used NPM website? 
Natalia - We used links on README, no guarentee of success
Faris - Do you need more time?
Natalia - Was ok, Promises need more introduction before challenge!

## Promises MC
Moses - Thought it was bad, didn't understand what promises are
Ariel - Maybe we should start using Promises straight away
Moses - Felt like I didn't learn anything
Faris - Agree with Ariel, Promises and Callbacks workshops should be closer together
Mario - Then you wouldn't see benifits of using Promises
Ariel - Confusing if people use different ways, we should learn a common way
Mario - There's no one common way of doing things in real world
Shireen - We teach you serveral things so you understand all of them. You need basics (eg: callbacks)
Hosen - We've been told Promises are important, however we didn't spend enough time learning them. We need an explanation with WS
Natalia - We spent too much time with callbacks
Shireen / FA - Next week is promises, you used them with fetch


## Stateless Session MGT
Natalia - Not enough explanation, documentation was confusing. We had to go to solution, very frustrating
Moses - It was bad, didn't understand everything. I had to look in solution file (Mohamed nods in agreement). Need pictures. Kept reading about JWT, but need something to illustrate what it is. Still don't understand

## Research
Faris - We're finally getting some pluses!
Shireen - You're not using research in a good way, next week is last one. 
Mario - The point is to teach you how to learn
Shireen - How were reserch topics
Natalia - Stateless sessions were useful, I like that it topics I wouldn't google myself

## Self-Awareness w/Danny
Moses - Was good IMO, but we were already in the middle of the code
Ariel - We were already in the zone 
Shireen - Next week you've got same thing
Natalia - I like Danny, but I'm not sure I was target audience because I didn't learn anything new (maybe because I'm older). Didn't learn anything about coding, I didn't get any negative feedback


## Clientside Validation
Moses - It was good, it's important because it comes up in interviews. But 1hr is not enough, maybe 1.5hr? Too much in 1hr, we need to do form and css, not everyone finished
Faris - Don't think you focus on css, 
Moses - But requirements told us to make css with our own design, we need to practice this
Faris - Maybe we need more time
Natalia - It was tough, not sure why we're doing it now, I think we've done this topic before. Maybe we should do this workshop earlier
Hosen - I used it, v.useful

## Projects
Natalia - Tough week
Mohammed - Understand in general authentication
Shireen - Do you review topics at home? Could you review at weekend, maybe build mini projects, and come to mentors with questions
Faris - You could also look at solutions, play around with code

## Stop

### Using old / primitive ways to code
Ariel - I did udemy course for node, everything was easier more readable
Moses - I think Ariel is right, if we google a problem - everything is in express so it's hard to find solutions
Ariel - When we did Code wars, it was the same. Everyone used newere solutions
Mario - Express is a layer above node, you don't see alot of important stuff. For example, status codes and headers. That's why we learn node before Express
Ariel - The way to heaven is through hell?
(yes)
Mario - Imagine building something with C++?
Shireen - It's the same as callbacks / React. We teach you this stuff so you know how to understand both, 
Hosen - There's not enough Node JS
Shireen - Node JS is massive! Use the docs

### WS while projects
Mohammed - we discussed this last week, horrible to do workshops while doing projects. Can't concentrate on workshops
Shireen - Schedule is tight, other people have scedules that we need to accomodate
Mohammed - But I'm talking about WS, we could do Client Side Validation before projects
Ariel - Annoying because we have to change our project code after WS
Shireen - You need to learn how to context switch, but I understand frustration

### Copying / Pasting code you don't understand

Ghassan - You're in your 7th week, it's not helpful to do this! If you try to change stuff you get bugs. You find it easier if you make the effort
Ariel - If the solution was easy, we would not search for it. 
Shireen - Good way to learn is C/P then removing lines to see what goes wrong

## Go

### Learn react at least 2 weeks

Mario - We're going to be using weeks for 8 weeks (projects)
Ariel - But only a week to learn?
Moses - It's a big field to learn
Faris - Course is about you, not material. We give you tools to learn, you must use them! You can search for what you need to learn. We can't teach all libraries, but we can teach you how to learn. It's a different technique than at Uni, 
Mario - React code is only 30% react, the rest is just JS. Basic react stuff only needs a week

### Learn Express and MongoDB, we need to know about this field

Moses - We need this
Ariel - It's very popular
Moses - Why don't we learn this instead of SQL
Mario - Only small projects use it
Shireen- You need to learn relational DBs, you have freedom to learn what you want in projects
Faris - There's tutorials online
Shireen - We don't have time to cover MongoDB in course, MySQL and PostgreSQL are just different syntax

### Tells us at least one challenge and how you solve it

Faris - In presentations, you should create challenge and show how you solved it.

### Carry over week 6 project into week 7

Jamie - Alot to do this week, maybe we should just add authentication to Week 6 project? 
Shireen - Everytime this was suggested, people wanted to start again

## Continue

### Spend enough Time to plan projects
Moses - More efficient
Shireen - I told this in week 1!
Natalia - You need to agree in the beginning

### Being serious
Faris - You should put more thought into this course, not sure how much you value it. You need to take it seriously and not play around

### Stop go continue
Hosen - Callback inside callback
