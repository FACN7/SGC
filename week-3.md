# Week 3

## Workshop feedback
#### Intro to Testing & TDD
General consensus was it was good.

#### Testing workshop (Fizzbuzz)
Natalia: The main part of this workshop was too simple.
Bobby: Would 1 hour workshop be better?
Omri: It's a good way to learn TDD

#### Roman numerals codealong
Natalia: I would use the extra hour from fizzbuzz to spend on roman
Bobby: How was the speed?
Karem: For someone who is new to testing, the pace was good. But, it could have also used an extra 30 mins
Faris: What do you think about the technique of codealongs?
Hosen: I think we moved a little too fast at times. 
Natalia: It was helpful for being able to practice writing tests.

#### Pure functions workshop
Omri: It was useful 
Faris: It's important to understand how to write reusable functions

Karem: Are we going to have a workshop for debugging?

#### Intro to recursion 
Faris: Do you think the Replit was useful? Would the theoretical presentation and slides approach work better?
Mohammed: I already knew what recursion was before the course
Natalia: I had an idea of what it was, but I enjoyed the chance to practice it.

#### Traffic lights morning challenge
General feedback is that the topic (callbacks) was complicated. 
Mohammed: I think sometimes we have workshops that are very complex, but we don't discuss the code enough afterwards. We should talk more about the code.
Hosen: We should have a refresher about callbacks before this workshop
Faris: We introduced them last week (Week 2).

#### Research afternoon
Omri: We should stop it.
Natalia: I like it because I probably wouldn't think to Google these topics on my own
Karem: We could replace this with something called 'Reading Hour' - or even just 20 minutes
Bobby: I also think you guys could be asking more questions

#### Waterfall morning challenge
It was difficult. Using recursion was tricky, we could do with more practice. It was good that we discussed the solution afterwards.
Mohammed: If there is any workshop that most of the cohort doesn't understand, we should spend more time talking about the solutions at the end.



-----
## STOP 

#### Doing research afternoons (already discussed)

#### Not showing up on time (Faris)
Faris: Being late affects the whole class. You should come in on time 

## Watching online courses during workshops
Mario: First day I came in, I found one person watching an online course, one person listening to a podcast
Mohammed: I think we should be able to watch short videos when we're researching a concept we do not understand.
Faris: We expect more pair programming, headphones and 
Bobby: Any time we see you using headphones during workhshops, we will ask you to stop using them

## GO

#### Connect research to our projects (Natalia)
Natalia: We should make sure the research topics are as connected to the projects as possible
Omri: Four hours is too long for research
Mohammed: 
Bobby: I

**Action Point (Everyone):** Think of ways to do research afternoon presentations that will engage the other students (i.e. use [Kahoots](https://kahoot.it/))

#### Telling a story in your presentations

Faris: You should plan your presentations. You don't want to be presenting without a plan. It says a lot about your personality. It's important for you to practice these soft skills. If you put in the effort, you will see yourselves improve, and you will be glad with the results.
Mario: I had to present in front of 20 people at my company - not fun, but I'm glad I did it

#### Debugging

Karem: Using console.log() isn't efficient. We should start using debugging (perhaps even have a small workshop on how to use it?). It would be nice to know that soething like this exists.

**Action point:** Add a section on debugging to the week 5 intro to error handling introduction presentation
