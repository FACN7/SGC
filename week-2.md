# Week 2

## Workshop feedback
#### Callback workshop
Natalia: Didn't understand why we had the presentation, as it was just reading from the slides
Ghassan: In some cases, codealongs are helpful. Feedback taken on board.
Bobby: What do you think about not getting through all of the solutions to workshops?
Eebrahim: Maybe it would be more efficient to go from the hardest solutions to the easiest ones

#### Event Loop video
Eebrahim: It wasn't really helpful. It was boring. Maybe doing a tutorial for it would be more interesting (instead of the video)
Ghassan: Yes, the main point of the event loop video was learning how Chrome's V8 engine works. It'll be important for you when you start writing more async code.

#### Flexbox dice morning challenge
Hosain: It could have been better organised, with a better set of instructions in the repo. The files weren't well organised. 
Karem: Yes, we didn't know if we were allowed to manipulate certain parts of the code.

#### Software Architecture Workshop
Concensus: It was good

#### Intro to NPM
Eebraheem: It was too short
Karem: There was some confusing references to testing in the readme for this workshop
Bobby: Yes, testing is next week's topic, so it'd be worth clarifying that Google is your friend for now

#### Software design workshop

#### Intro to projects
Omri: This week's project was not challenging enough
Ghassan & Bobby: The projects will get more challenging each week.

#### Data manipulation workshop
Concensus: This was a useful workshop

## STOP
[No one wrote any stops on the board today...]


## GO 
### Make Thursday a short day (Omri)
Omri: Let's finish at 3pm! 

### Add interview preparation (Mohammed)
Mohammed: Please can we have some sessions where we tackle practice technical interview questions?

### Make more sprints (Ebraheem)
Ebraheem: Can we make the projects shorter? We have too much time and they are too easy.

### Write more modular code (Ghassan)
Ghassan: It's not enough that you and your team understand the code - you should make it readable for everyone else. Simplify and refactor your code so anyone could read it and understand it without too much difficulty

### Using one laptop for morning challenges (Bobby)
Bobby: I'll encourage you to do this for morning challenges next week

## CONTINUE
### Commenting your code (Bobby)
Bobby: Was really good to see projects with comments to explain what functions do and how they work. Your future selves will thank your present selves for taking the time to write these messages. Plus, well commented repos are a great learning resource for the rest of the group.
Karem: Please can the mentors encourage students to do this?
